# requirement-analysis
## 📌 Purpose of the Repository

This repository serves as a structured workspace to perform and document the **requirement analysis phase** of a software project — specifically for a **Booking Management System**.

It is designed to simulate a real-world software development scenario by guiding developers through the process of:

- Gathering and analyzing project requirements
- Distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements
- Documenting use cases and acceptance criteria
- Creating system diagrams and visual representations
- Producing clear, professional, and industry-standard documentation

The ultimate goal is to lay a strong foundation for the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by ensuring that the project’s scope, expectations, and user needs are clearly defined and agreed upon before implementation begins.

This project reinforces core skills in **requirement engineering**, which is critical to building scalable, maintainable, and successful software systems.
## 🧠 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are identified, documented, analyzed, and validated before any actual development begins.

This process ensures that everyone involved in the project — from clients to developers — has a clear and shared understanding of **what the software system must do** and **how it should perform**. It sets the foundation for the entire project by answering key questions like:

- What problem is the software solving?
- Who are the users?
- What features and functionality are needed?
- What constraints and limitations exist?

### ✨ Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:

- ✅ **Clarity & Alignment**: Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system’s purpose and scope.
- ✅ **Reduces Rework**: Catching gaps or misunderstandings early avoids costly changes later in the development cycle.
- ✅ **Improves Planning**: Helps in accurate estimation of time, resources, and budget.
- ✅ **Guides Design & Development**: Acts as a blueprint for system architecture and feature implementation.
- ✅ **Enhances Quality**: Well-defined requirements lead to better testing, validation, and user satisfaction.
## ❓ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in the success of any software project. It ensures the software meets user expectations, aligns with business goals, and is feasible to implement. Here are three key reasons why this phase is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

### 1. ✅ Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
Clear and detailed requirements minimize the risk of misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers. Without this clarity, developers might build a system that doesn’t align with business needs, leading to costly revisions and scope creep.

### 2. ✅ Improves Project Planning and Estimation
By understanding what needs to be built, teams can accurately estimate time, resources, cost, and effort. This helps in setting realistic deadlines and budget allocations, leading to more efficient project management.

### 3. ✅ Enhances Product Quality and User Satisfaction
Well-defined requirements guide the development and testing phases, ensuring the final product behaves as expected. This leads to fewer bugs, better performance, and higher satisfaction among users and clients.
## 🔍 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The Requirement Analysis process consists of several key activities that ensure the success of a software project by thoroughly understanding and defining what needs to be built.

- **📥 Requirement Gathering**  
  Engage with stakeholders to collect initial requirements.  
  Use various techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops.

- **🗣️ Requirement Elicitation**  
  Refine and elaborate on the gathered requirements.  
  Use techniques like brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.

- **📝 Requirement Documentation**  
  Document the requirements in a detailed and structured format.  
  Use requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases.

- **📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyze and prioritize the requirements.  
  Create models to visualize and understand the requirements.

- **✅ Requirement Validation**  
  Review and validate the requirements with stakeholders.  
  Define acceptance criteria and ensure traceability.
