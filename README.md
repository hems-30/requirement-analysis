# requirement-analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Purpose of the Repository

This repository serves as a structured workspace to perform and document the **requirement analysis phase** of a software project â€” specifically for a **Booking Management System**.

It is designed to simulate a real-world software development scenario by guiding developers through the process of:

- Gathering and analyzing project requirements
- Distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements
- Documenting use cases and acceptance criteria
- Creating system diagrams and visual representations
- Producing clear, professional, and industry-standard documentation

The ultimate goal is to lay a strong foundation for the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by ensuring that the projectâ€™s scope, expectations, and user needs are clearly defined and agreed upon before implementation begins.

This project reinforces core skills in **requirement engineering**, which is critical to building scalable, maintainable, and successful software systems.
## ðŸ§  What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are identified, documented, analyzed, and validated before any actual development begins.

This process ensures that everyone involved in the project â€” from clients to developers â€” has a clear and shared understanding of **what the software system must do** and **how it should perform**. It sets the foundation for the entire project by answering key questions like:

- What problem is the software solving?
- Who are the users?
- What features and functionality are needed?
- What constraints and limitations exist?

### âœ¨ Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:

- âœ… **Clarity & Alignment**: Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the systemâ€™s purpose and scope.
- âœ… **Reduces Rework**: Catching gaps or misunderstandings early avoids costly changes later in the development cycle.
- âœ… **Improves Planning**: Helps in accurate estimation of time, resources, and budget.
- âœ… **Guides Design & Development**: Acts as a blueprint for system architecture and feature implementation.
- âœ… **Enhances Quality**: Well-defined requirements lead to better testing, validation, and user satisfaction.
