# requirement-analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Purpose of the Repository

This repository serves as a structured workspace to perform and document the **requirement analysis phase** of a software project â€” specifically for a **Booking Management System**.

It is designed to simulate a real-world software development scenario by guiding developers through the process of:

- Gathering and analyzing project requirements
- Distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements
- Documenting use cases and acceptance criteria
- Creating system diagrams and visual representations
- Producing clear, professional, and industry-standard documentation

The ultimate goal is to lay a strong foundation for the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by ensuring that the projectâ€™s scope, expectations, and user needs are clearly defined and agreed upon before implementation begins.

This project reinforces core skills in **requirement engineering**, which is critical to building scalable, maintainable, and successful software systems.
